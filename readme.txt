Combining Parts 1 and 2, my site features jQuery validation, two-way binding for 
jQuery UI slider and text box, and tabs that display a newly generated table with 
its dimensions as the tab name. Users have the option to delete tabs either individually
or altogether, while the table on the active tab dynamically updates in response to new 
input in the box or changes in the slider.
